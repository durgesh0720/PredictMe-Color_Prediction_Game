```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=GameRound)
def handle_game_round_completion(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    # Sends notifications when game rounds complete
```

## üîß Configuration

### Rate Limiting Thresholds

```python
# Email rate limits
EMAIL_RATE_LIMIT = 10  # per hour per user

# Suspicious betting thresholds
RAPID_BETTING_THRESHOLD = 10  # bets in 5 minutes
LARGE_BET_THRESHOLD = 0.5     # 50% of balance
PATTERN_BETTING_THRESHOLD = 15 # same color in 1 hour

# Balance thresholds
LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD = 100   # ‚Çπ100
BIG_WIN_THRESHOLD = 500       # ‚Çπ500
```

### Cache Keys

```python
# Rate limiting
f"email_notification_{user_id}"
f"rapid_betting_alert_{player_id}"
f"large_bet_alert_{player_id}"
f"pattern_betting_alert_{player_id}"

# Notification tracking
f"bet_notification_sent_{bet_id}"
f"round_completed_{round_id}"
f"email_verified_{player_id}"
```

## üìã Management Commands

### Send Bulk Notifications

```bash
# Send maintenance notification
python manage.py send_notifications \
    --type maintenance \
    --title "Scheduled Maintenance" \
    --message "System will be down for 2 hours" \
    --priority high \
    --verified-only

# Send promotional announcement
python manage.py send_notifications \
    --type announcement \
    --title "New Feature Available" \
    --message "Check out our new color option!" \
    --priority normal
```

### Background Tasks

```bash
# Run scheduled tasks manually
python manage.py shell -c "from polling.tasks import run_scheduled_tasks; run_scheduled_tasks()"

# Clean up old notifications
python manage.py shell -c "from polling.tasks import cleanup_old_notifications; cleanup_old_notifications()"
```

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Signal Performance

```python
# Check signal execution time
import time
start_time = time.time()
# ... signal execution ...
duration = time.time() - start_time
logger.info(f"Signal executed in {duration:.3f} seconds")
```

### Notification Tracking

```python
# Check notification delivery status
notifications = Notification.objects.filter(
    user=user,
    created_at__gte=timezone.now() - timedelta(hours=1)
)

for notification in notifications:
    print(f"{notification.title}: {notification.status}")
    print(f"Email sent: {notification.email_sent}")
    print(f"In-app delivered: {notification.in_app_delivered}")
```

### Error Handling

All signals include comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    # Signal logic
    notify_user(...)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Signal error: {e}")
    # Continue execution without breaking the request
```

## üéõÔ∏è Customization

### Adding New Signals

1. **Create Signal Function:**
```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=YourModel)
def handle_your_event(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    try:
        # Your notification logic
        notify_user(...)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in your signal: {e}")
```

2. **Register in apps.py:**
```python
def ready(self):
    import polling.signals
```

3. **Add Rate Limiting:**
```python
cache_key = f"your_notification_{user_id}"
if not cache.get(cache_key):
    # Send notification
    cache.set(cache_key, True, 3600)  # 1 hour cooldown
```

### Configuring Thresholds

Adjust detection thresholds in `signals.py`:

```python
# Modify these values as needed
RAPID_BETTING_THRESHOLD = 15  # Increase for less sensitive detection
LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD = 50    # Decrease for earlier warnings
BIG_WIN_THRESHOLD = 1000      # Increase for higher celebration threshold
```

## üìä Analytics

### Signal Effectiveness

Track signal performance:

```python
# Notification delivery rates
total_sent = Notification.objects.filter(status='sent').count()
total_delivered = Notification.objects.filter(in_app_delivered=True).count()
delivery_rate = (total_delivered / total_sent) * 100

# User engagement
read_notifications = Notification.objects.filter(read_at__isnull=False).count()
engagement_rate = (read_notifications / total_delivered) * 100
```

### Performance Metrics

Monitor signal impact:

```python
# Signal execution frequency
signal_executions = cache.get('signal_executions', 0)
cache.set('signal_executions', signal_executions + 1, 3600)

# Database impact
query_count_before = len(connection.queries)
# ... signal execution ...
query_count_after = len(connection.queries)
queries_used = query_count_after - query_count_before
```

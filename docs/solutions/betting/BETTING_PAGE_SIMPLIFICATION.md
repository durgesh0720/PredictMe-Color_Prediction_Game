.color-box::after {
    display: none !important;
}

.color-box {
    background: var(--game-red) !important;
    box-shadow: none !important;
    transform: none !important;
}

.color-box:hover {
    transform: translateY(-2px) !important;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) !important;
}

/* Simplified button styles */
.btn {
    background: var(--primary-color) !important;
    border-radius: var(--border-radius-md) !important;

# Consumers.py Syntax Error Fix

## Problem Identified

The Django server was failing to start with a syntax error in `polling/consumers.py`:

```
File "/home/durgesh/Desktop/Programs/WebSocket_Test/polling/consumers.py", line 1369
    def _get_client_ip(self):
SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block
```

## Root Cause

The `handle_timer_update` method had an incomplete `try` block:

**Before (Broken)**:
```python
async def handle_timer_update(self, time_remaining: float, phase: str):
    """Handle timer updates from server-authoritative timer"""
    try:
        # ... method implementation ...
        
        # Send to admin panel (lightweight, no reliability)
        await self.channel_layer.group_send(
            "admin_game_control",
            timer_data
        )

def _get_client_ip(self):  # ‚ùå Missing except/finally block
```

## Solution Applied

Added the missing `except` block to properly handle exceptions:

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
async def handle_timer_update(self, time_remaining: float, phase: str):
    """Handle timer updates from server-authoritative timer"""
    try:
        # ... method implementation ...
        
        # Send to admin panel (lightweight, no reliability)
        await self.channel_layer.group_send(
            "admin_game_control",
            timer_data
        )

    except Exception as e:  # ‚úÖ Added missing except block
        logger.error(f"Error handling timer update in room {self.room_name}: {e}")

def _get_client_ip(self):  # ‚úÖ Now properly separated
```

## Additional Cleanup

Also removed duplicate lines that were accidentally added at the end of the file:

**Removed**:
```python
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error handling timer update in room {self.room_name}: {e}")
```

## Verification

### ‚úÖ System Check Passed:
```bash
python manage.py check
# System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
```

### ‚úÖ Server Can Start:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
# Starting ASGI/Daphne version 4.2.1 development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Files Modified

- **`polling/consumers.py`** - Fixed syntax error in `handle_timer_update` method

## Impact

- ‚úÖ Django server can now start successfully
- ‚úÖ WebSocket functionality is preserved
- ‚úÖ Error handling is properly implemented
- ‚úÖ No functionality lost

## Summary

The syntax error was caused by an incomplete `try` block in the `handle_timer_update` method. The fix was simple but critical:

1. **Added missing `except` block** to handle exceptions properly
2. **Removed duplicate code** that was accidentally added
3. **Verified the fix** with system checks and server startup

The server should now start without any syntax errors! üöÄ

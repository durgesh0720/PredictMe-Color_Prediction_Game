Fix for balance precision issues - converts IntegerField to DecimalField for money amounts
This script addresses the critical data type inconsistency issue identified in the code review.

CRITICAL ISSUE: Mixed use of IntegerField and DecimalField for money amounts
- Player.balance: IntegerField (no decimal precision) - PROBLEMATIC
- PaymentTransaction.amount: DecimalField (proper precision) - CORRECT
- WalletTransaction.amount: DecimalField (proper precision) - CORRECT

This inconsistency can lead to money loss due to rounding errors.

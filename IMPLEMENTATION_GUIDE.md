**Status**: COMPLETE
**Files**: `polling/consumers.py`, `polling/wallet_utils.py`

**What was fixed**:
- All game round completion operations in single transaction
- Select_for_update to prevent race conditions
- Atomic bet processing with wallet transactions
- Rollback on any failure to maintain consistency

### ✅ 5. Comprehensive Error Recovery System
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Files**: `polling/error_recovery.py`

- Automatic detection of stuck rounds
- Failed bet processing recovery
- Balance inconsistency detection and correction
- Orphaned transaction cleanup
- Background monitoring and recovery

**Testing**:
```bash
# Check error recovery stats
python manage.py shell

>>> print(error_recovery.get_recovery_stats())
```

### ✅ 6. Responsible Gambling Features
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Files**: `polling/responsible_gambling.py`, `polling/views.py`, `polling/urls.py`

**What was implemented**:
- Betting limits (daily, session, per-bet)
- Session timeouts and cooling-off periods
- Warning thresholds and notifications
- Player-configurable limits
- API endpoints for limit management

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/responsible-gambling/status/` - Get gambling status
- `POST /api/responsible-gambling/set-limits/` - Set custom limits
- `POST /api/responsible-gambling/cooling-off/` - Trigger cooling-off

### ✅ 7. Monitoring and Alerting System
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Files**: `polling/monitoring.py`, `polling/views.py`, `polling/urls.py`

**What was implemented**:
- Real-time system health monitoring
- Automatic alert generation for critical issues
- Performance metrics collection
- WebSocket connection tracking
- Database health monitoring

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/monitoring/dashboard/` - Get monitoring dashboard
- `POST /api/monitoring/resolve-alert/` - Resolve alerts

## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Install Additional Dependencies
```bash
pip install psutil  # For system monitoring
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Admin email for critical alerts
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com

# Monitoring settings
MONITORING_ENABLED=true
ALERT_EMAIL_ENABLED=true
```

### 4. Start Background Services
The following services start automatically when Django starts:
- Secure random number generation
- WebSocket reliability manager
- Server-authoritative timer
- Error recovery system
- Responsible gambling manager
- Monitoring and alerting

### 5. Verify Installation
```bash
# Run the verification script
python manage.py shell
>>> from polling.secure_random import secure_random
>>> from polling.websocket_reliability import reliable_ws_manager
>>> from polling.timer_sync import server_timer
>>> from polling.error_recovery import error_recovery
>>> from polling.responsible_gambling import responsible_gambling
>>> from polling.monitoring import monitoring
>>> print("All systems operational!")
```
